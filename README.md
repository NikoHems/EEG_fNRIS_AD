# Alzheimers DIsease Prediction using EEG & fNRIS data

The repository "EEG_fNRIS_AD" is a project from UC Berkeley's Introduction to Neurotechnology course. It focuses on analyzing EEG (Electroencephalography) and fNIRS (Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) data to detect early signs of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The project employs machine learning techniques to identify biomarkers indicative of cognitive decline, aiming to facilitate early diagnosis and personalized interventions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **DataBase/**: Contains datasets used for analysis.
- **EEG_fNIRS/**: Includes scripts and resources related to EEG and fNIRS data processing.
- **model.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook detailing the machine learning model development and evaluation.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **LICENSE**: The project's licensing information.
- **README.md**: Provides an overview and documentation of the project.

## Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NikoHems/EEG_fNRIS_AD.git
   cd EEG_fNRIS_AD
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Navigate to the `EEG_fNIRS/` directory for scripts related to data preprocessing.
   - Ensure that the datasets are correctly placed in the `DataBase/` directory.

2. **Model Training and Evaluation**:

   - Open the `model.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook to follow the steps for training and evaluating the machine learning models.
